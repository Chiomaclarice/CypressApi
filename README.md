# Cypress API Testing

This repository explores API testing using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). It includes example test cases for making HTTP requests, validating responses, and testing RESTful endpoints.

The tests are written using `cy.request()` and are organized under `cypress/e2e`.

Feel free to explore and adapt the tests to your own API scenarios.
